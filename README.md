# Smart Logger Extension for Python in Visual Studio Code

## Description
The Smart Logger Extension is a specialized tool for Python developers using Visual Studio Code.
It simplifies the debugging process by intelligently integrating logging into your Python code.
Whether you're debugging a complex application or simply want to enhance your code's transparency, 
this extension streamlines the logging process, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

## Features

### 1. Manual Logging with Keyboard Shortcut
- **Easy Variable Logging**: Select any variable in your Python code and press `Ctrl+L` to automatically add a debug logging statement for that variable.
- **Intelligent Import Management**: If your code doesn't already include the logging module, the extension will automatically import it for you, ensuring that your logging statements work seamlessly.

### 2. Automatic Logging Using OpenAI API
- **AI-Powered Logging**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to analyze your Python code and insert appropriate logging statements intelligently. This feature understands the context and flow of your code to provide meaningful logs.
- **Customizable Logging**: Through the configuration UI, you can customize the logging level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING) and specify the log file, tailoring the logging to suit your specific needs and preferences.

### Additional Features
- **Seamless Integration**: As a VS Code extension, it integrates directly into your development environment, allowing for a smooth and uninterrupted coding experience.
- **Efficient Code Enhancement**: Enhance your Python code with advanced logging capabilities without distracting from the main development workflow.
